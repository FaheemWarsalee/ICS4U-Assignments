Brief Description: Write a program that makes change for amounts less than one dollar.  Input to the program should be a positive
integer less than 100, representing an amount of money, in cents.  Output should be the original amount of money together with a set of 
coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) that could make up that amount.
Improvements:
The program should produce change containing the minimum number of coins required.
The output should be expressed in a natural form.  For example, don't refer to zero coins of a particular type, or the singular or plural forms for coins should be used correctly (i.e., "1 dime", not "1 dimes").*/
